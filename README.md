SquishBox.js
============

This is a free jQuery plugin that will take a set of 4 Square Images and generates a Square gallery that animates while being hovered over.

There are a few things you need to do before getting it up and running.

1: Link to SquishBox.js in your header.
2: Add 4 Square(!important) Images to your HTML markup, and give them the class names "box1", "box2", "box3", "box4".
3: Put the images inside a wrapping div that has a specified width in your stylesheet (e.g width:100%;).

For an example of the squishing animted effect check out my the Blog section of my homepage here www.ryaniusi.com
