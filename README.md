SquishBox.js Alpha
============

This is a free jQuery plugin that will take a set of 4 Square Images and generate a Square gallery that animates and squishes while being hovered over.

There are a few things you need to do before getting it up and running.

1: Link to SquishBox.js in your header.

2: Add 4 Square(!important) Images to your HTML markup, and give them the class names "box1", "box2", "box3", "box4".

3: Put the images inside a wrapping div that has a specified width in your stylesheet (e.g width:100%;).


For an example of the squishing animted effect check out this test page http://ryaniusi.com/SquishBoxTest/
